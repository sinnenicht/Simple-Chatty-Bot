# SimpleChattyBot
 
A very simple chat bot that can guess your age, count to any number (within reason!), and gives you a quick quiz on programming.

Prerequisites
-------------

This program requires Java to compile and run.

Installation
------------

1. Download this repository and unzip the .zip file in your desired location.
2. Using the command line, navigate to \SimpleChattyBot-master\src\bot.
3. Compile the program using the command `javac SimpleBot.java`.

Usage
-----

Once SimpleBot has been compiled, it can be run from the command line by navigating to \SimpleChattyBot-master\src and using the command `java bot.SimpleBot`.

Once Simple Chatty Bot is running, the user can answer the bot's questions by inputting text. Answers involving numbers should be entered as integers, i.e. `1` rather than `one`.
